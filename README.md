# Recurrent-Neural-Network
Implementation of a general Recurrent Neural Network class with FORCE learning. We will use Dynamics Components Analysis and other statistical analysis techniques to map its activity onto low-dimensional subspaces and understand how network dynamics change during and after the training period.

Based on the paper, "Generating Coherent Patterns of Activity from Chaotic Neural Networks" by Sussillo and Abbott, 2009

See the initial results at initial_results.pdf for more information. Also, look in the Test folder for implementation examples.

Apart from analyzing the neural activity, I am also curious about whether having learned one task will make it easier for a network to learn a second task. There are a few ideas I have about how to accomplish such an analysis, including holding certain weights constant during the training periods, but they are not fully flushed out.
