# Recurrent-Neural-Network
Implementation of a general Recurrent Neural Network class with FORCE learning. To be used in conjunction with Dynamics Components Analysis to map its activity onto low-dimensional subspaces.

Based on the paper, "Generating Coherent Patterns of Activity from Chaotic Neural Networks" by Sussillo and Abbott, 2009
