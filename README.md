# Recurrent-Neural-Network
Implementation of a general Recurrent Neural Network class with FORCE learning. To be used in conjunction with Dynamics Components Analysis to map its activity onto low-dimensional subspaces.

Based on the paper, "Generating Coherent Patterns of Activity from Chaotic Neural Networks" by Sussillo and Abbott, 2009

See the initial results at initial_results.pdf for more information. Also, look in the Test folder for implementation examples.

Apart from analyzing the neural activity, I am also curious about whether having learned one task will make it easier for a network to learn a second task. There are a few ideas I have about how to accomplish such an analysis, including holding certain weights constant during the training periods, but they are not fully flushed out.
